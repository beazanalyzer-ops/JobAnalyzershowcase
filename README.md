## What It Does

Ontario's new 2026 job posting law requires employers to include specific information in every job posting. Most job seekers don't know what's missing — and most postings fall short.

**Job Analyzer** lets you paste any job description and instantly find out:

- ✅ **Compliance Score** — out of 100
- 📋 **Verdict** — a one-sentence plain-language summary
- 🔍 **Missing Requirements** — a clear list of what the employer left out

When you're done, click **Analyze Another Job** to start fresh.
